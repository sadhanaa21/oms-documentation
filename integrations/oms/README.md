## Introduction

Integrations with Order Management Systems (OMS) play a pivotal role in enhancing operational 
efficiency and streamlining business processes. In the dynamic landscape of modern commerce, 
where businesses rely on diverse tools and platforms for various functions, integrations serve 
as the bridge that connects these disparate systems.

Integrations facilitate seamless connection and data exchange between  OMS and other critical 
business application systems, such as E-commerce, Inventory management, Enterprise Resource
Planning (ERP), Point Of Sale (POS) and many more.

## Integration Feeds

Feed files serve as the medium for seamless integration with Order Management Systems (OMS), 
acting as the channel for data exchange between OMS and external systems within the business ecosystem. 

OMS facilitates integration by offering a predefined set of Out-of-the-Box (OOTB) feed files 
tailored to its features. These files contain structured data that external systems can easily 
interpret and utilize, fostering a standardized and efficient means of communication.

The OOTB feed files provided by OMS encapsulate essential information related to various features, 
such as orders, inventory, shipment, returns etc. External systems can leverage these files to 
ingest, update, or extract data, ensuring a synchronized and accurate flow of information across 
the entire business infrastructure.
