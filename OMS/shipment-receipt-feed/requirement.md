# Requirement

The generated feed is in JSON format. The OMS JSON is organized shipment-wise, containing information about each shipment's items and receipt details. This feed is used to obtain shipment receipt details.

To generate the feed in Moqui, a service job is configured. It runs on a schedule, creates the feed, and stores it on the SFTP.

The following parameters are configured for the service job:

NOTE: The values of parameters used to fetch and generate the feed for eligible purchase order shipment receipts are included.
